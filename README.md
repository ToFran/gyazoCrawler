1. Download/Index database of gyazos - will fetch gyazo.com and create your database of links;
2. Calculate the size and download the all the images from the DB - will calculate the size from the database file, and then ask if you want them to be downloaded, if so they will go on the specified folder.

For the Gyazo team/company:
 - You guys are awesome;
 - I could not find anything that explicitly said, that this practice of recovering and downloading old *gyazos* was against your policy.
 - I completely understand that you may not like this, if you want to stop it you should  remove 
```"url"```,```"permalink_url"``` and ```"permalink_path"``` 
from the JSON response
 - If you wish the removal of this repo just tweet me [@tofran_] and Iâ€™ll do it as soon as possible.
