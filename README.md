# gyazoCrawler

gyazoCrawler is a python scrip to download and index Gyazo screenshots.

I'm not affiliated with Gyazo in any way.

For the Gyazo team/company:
 - You guys are awesome;
 - I could not find anything that explicitly said, that this practice of recovering and downloading old *gyazos* was against your policy.
 - I completely understand that you may not like this, if you want to stop it you should  remove 
```"url"```,```"permalink_url"``` and ```"permalink_path"``` 
from the JSON response
 - If you wish the removal of this repo just tweet me [@tofran_] and Iâ€™ll do it as soon as possible.
